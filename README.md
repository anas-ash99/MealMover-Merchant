# MealMover Merchant App

I have developed a merchant-side application for Mealmovers, allowing merchants to receive real-time updates on new orders made by users on the main app. The application was built using Java programming language.

## Features

- Real-time order updates: Merchants can receive instant notifications about new orders placed by users on the main Mealmovers app. This allows them to stay updated and respond promptly to customer orders.
- Order management: The app provides a user-friendly interface for managing orders. Merchants can view order details, update the order status, mark orders as fulfilled, and track the progress of each order.
- Seamless integration: The MealMover Merchant app seamlessly integrates with the Mealmovers platform, ensuring efficient communication between users and merchants.

## Technologies Used

The MealMover Merchant app is built using the following technologies:

- Java programming language: The app's core logic and functionality are implemented using Java.
- MVVM architecture: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern.
- Firebase Firestore: The app utilizes Firebase Firestore, a NoSQL cloud database, to handle real-time data synchronization between the main Mealmovers app and the MealMover Merchant app.
- Android SDK: The app is developed using the Android Software Development Kit (SDK), which provides a rich set of tools and libraries for building Android applications.


## Usage


By simply clicking [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mrdS0GgXLzRcxDOG37z0kWrDlCo4nOc1/view?usp=share_link), you can download the APK file of the app. Once the MealMover Merchant app is successfully installed and launched, there is no need to sign in or sign up. The app automatically logs in as Domino's, displaying only the orders placed through the main app on the screen.
