# MealMover Merchant App

I have developed a merchant-side application for Mealmovers, allowing merchants to receive real-time updates on new orders made by users on the main app. The application was built using Java programming language.

## Features

- Real-time order updates: Merchants can receive instant notifications about new orders placed by users on the main Mealmovers app. This allows them to stay updated and respond promptly to customer orders.
- Order management: The app provides a user-friendly interface for managing orders. Merchants can view order details, update the order status, mark orders as fulfilled, and track the progress of each order.
- Seamless integration: The MealMover Merchant app seamlessly integrates with the Mealmovers platform, ensuring efficient communication between users and merchants.

## Technologies Used

The MealMover Merchant app is built using the following technologies:

- Java programming language: The app's core logic and functionality are implemented using Java, a robust and widely-used programming language.
- MVVM architecture: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, which helps separate the concerns of data management, UI presentation, and user interactions.
- Firebase Firestore: The app utilizes Firebase Firestore, a NoSQL cloud database, to handle real-time data synchronization between the main Mealmovers app and the MealMover Merchant app. Firestore enables seamless communication and instant updates for new orders.
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM): FCM is used to deliver push notifications to the MealMover Merchant app, ensuring that merchants receive timely updates on new orders.
- Android SDK: The app is developed using the Android Software Development Kit (SDK), which provides a rich set of tools and libraries for building Android applications.
